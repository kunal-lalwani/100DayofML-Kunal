**Today's Progress**: Learnt Basics of Probability

**Thoughts:** 

## Kolmogorov’s Probability Axioms:
* Probability is a real number greater or equal to 0 : $  0 <= P(A)<=1$
* Total probability is equal to 1: Total Area = 1
* Probability of mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities : $P(A,B) = P(A) + P(B)$ 

## General Procedure:

- Enumerate all possible outcomes
- Calculate the “Area” of each outcome 
- The Probability of a given outcome is the fraction of the total Area it occupies 
- **Histogram** - $N(X)$: Observed Frequency of each outcome  
- **Probability Distribution** - $P(X)$: Probability associated with every possible outcome 
- **Cumulative Probability Distribution** - $P(X<=x)$: Probability associated with outcomes smaller or equal to each outcome

## Combinatorics:

- **Permutations**: The total number of possible sequences of $n$ different elements: $n! = n ⋅ (n − 1) ⋅ (n − 2)⋯1$

- **Combinations**: The total number of ways of grouping $N$ elements into two groups of size $k$ and $N-k$: $$C\binom Nk = \displaystyle \frac{N!}{k!(N − k)!}$$

- With just these two ideas we can easily calculate the number of possible outcomes in many situations
